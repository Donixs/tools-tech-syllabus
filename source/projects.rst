Final Project
#############

The final project is to produce a substantial document through one of the tools we
examine over the semester.

I recommend doing the project in RST/Sphinx or DITA, for several reasons:

* You will have more time to apply what we learn. If you wait to use tools we cover
  near the end of the term, you will need to rush.

* Tools for using the markup languages we cover are free. You will not have to
  worry about licenses and trial periods.

* You will be able to use GitHub to manage your project, which will make it
  easy for me (and other students) to provide feedback, and for you to iterate
  through revisions using the GitHub Flow.

* Finally, I believe that the direct use of markup languages is a growing
  requirement for technical writers, and doing a substantial project that you
  can share and continue to enhance will help you in a job search.

.. Partners
	**********

	While you will complete your own project, you will have a partner. The
	partner's role is to provide feedback and help. You are free to share your
	work in progress with others in the class, but you must have at least one
	designated partner.

	In addition, being a partner to another student will help you see project
	development from a different angle. You might think of things when looking at
	your partner's project that you would not see in your own work.

	Finally, having a partner, or "peer editor" is something you'll have to do as
	a professional technical writer.

	Ideally, your partner will be using the same tools in his or her project,
	though this isn't a requirement.
