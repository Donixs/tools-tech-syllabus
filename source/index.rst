Tools and Technologies for Technical Writers
#####################################################

**Middlesex Community College**

This course will help you become familiar with a wide variety of current tools
and technologies writers use to publish online content.

Getting Started
******************

To get started, we will set up our content management system and an editor.
And we'll learn about HTML, which is the format in which we'll deliver all
information.

   sublime

Markup Languages
******************

Now that we've learned some HTML, it should be apparent that writing large volumes of content directly in HTML would not be efficient.  There are several markup languages that we can use to produce HTML more easily.  We'll look at some of the most common.

   sphinx
   rtd
   xml
   dita-intro
   dita
   dita-maps

Publishing Systems
*******************

There are many more robust publishing systems that we can use to develop
content with more fine-grained control.  These programs offer more features
and capabilities than markup languages, but also involve more complexity and
overhead. We can still produce HTML, as well as some other formats.
