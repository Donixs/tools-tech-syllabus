Tools and Technologies for Technical Writers
#####################################################

**Middlesex Community College**

This course will help you become familiar with a wide variety of current tools
and technologies writers use to publish online content.

Getting Started
******************

To get started, we will set up our content management system and an editor.
And we'll learn about HTML, which is the format in which we'll deliver all
information.

Sphinx and RST
******************

Now that we've learned some HTML, it should be apparent that writing large volumes of content directly in HTML would not be efficient.  There are several markup languages that we can use to produce HTML more easily.  We'll look in some detail at a common tool stack: Sphinx and RST..

   sublime
   rst
   sphinx
   rtd
   
.. note:: I also maintain a separate document, :xref:`Sphinx_Sublime_Doc` that goes into more detail about these technologies than we will cover in class.  It might be useful to those who do a final project with Sphinx.

XML and DITA
******************

DITA is an XML schema used extensively in technical documentation, especially
at large organizations such as IBM and Oracle. DITA enables. **structured
authoring**, which requires writers to adhere to a set of structural rules.

Publishing Systems
*******************

There are many more robust publishing systems that we can use to develop
content with more fine-grained control.  These programs offer more features
and capabilities than markup languages, but also involve more complexity and
overhead. We can still produce HTML, as well as some other formats.

Unlike the previously-covered technologies, these tools require a paid
license. For purposes of this course, you can get a 30-day trial license.
